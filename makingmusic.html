                <p>
                    Now that you have the basics down, you are ready to start making your own music. But first you will need a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) to begin creating music.

                <p>
                    A DAW is essentially a piece of software that is used for recording, editing and producing audio files. 
                    Audio can be recorded into a DAW either by using a microphone connected to your device or by using MIDI, 
                    which essentially lets you click in notes to create chords, melodies, drum patterns etc.

                <p>
                    Learning basic music theory is essential for enhancing creativity and developing musical awareness. It's 
                    a challenging but rewarding set of skills to learn.
                    Knowing how music works will make the music production process easier and help you become an 
                    effective music producer.
                    Is learning music theory required? No. However, you can benefit from learning some aspects of music theory.
                    Musical theory is not a set of rules or guidelines you must follow. It's only a tool to help you understand and 
                    explain how music works. <a href="https://iconcollective.edu/basic-music-theory/">more info</a>
